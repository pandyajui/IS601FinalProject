<b>Feature:</b>Takes in data from the database (I used Weight and Height) and displays it in a scatter plot chart. 
Data is taken in JSON format and then pushed into the data feature for the chart. I used the chart.js setup to create the chart.
<ul>
<li>A graph comparing Height and Weight.</li>
</ul>
